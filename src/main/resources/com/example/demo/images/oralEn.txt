Generality : 

- Automation gonna replace some jobs but it will also create
new ones 

- It will probably give rise to industries that never existed

- There are some industries will be impacted by AI in terms
of labor workforce, being dimished but there are some industries
that don't have force for sustain it so that disconnect

- The future is not humans being replaces by machines is fuguring out how to do their job better with the help of machines 

- If we can figure out how to integrate AI technologuies, not to replace humans but augment their abilities to make life more fun to make us more productive
and more creative

How machine learning is making things more productive,
 more efficient, safer and cleaner. 


The trucking industry : 
E-commerce is driving demand for shiping higher than ever

industry: 
self driving cars, self driving trucks;
-> new industry autonomous driving industries 

airline are flying by themselves 

-> we will see fleets of automated trucks long before we 
self driving cars in the city



Movement industry : 

structured environment are good for automation smooth surfaces, right angles less chances for chaos 


But what about more complexe humans environments :

More complexe industry :
RoboHub 








amazon warehouse : robots and humans are working together 




Making pizza 
wasted food 

Revolutions of technologies : 

First revolution :

in 1850's train were the most popular mode of transportation : This chart shows the number of locomotive, engineers, railroad conductors and brakemen
increasing by nearly 600%. But that growth slowed in the nearly 1990's.


Second revolution : 
Then Automobile came along, car mechanic and repairman jobs surged even though 	railroad jobs began to disappear, 

Third and fourth revolution :
And some companies say that the same thing will happen when robots move into the marketplace :


Chiffres : 
A recent study found up to 670 000 us jobs were lost to robots between 1990 and 2007 and that number is likely to grow up 
a widely-cited study from 2013 found nearly half of all jobs in the US are in danger of being automated over the next 20 years. 

Occupation that require repetitive and predictable tasks in trasportation, logistics and administrative support were especially high-risk


Positif about AI : 
- Many of economist argue automation will ultimaley create new jobs 

Negatif about AI : 
- AI will change significantly tasks This is particulary a problem for lower-skilled workers who aren't able to retrain for new jobs;
They might be stuck with lower wages in a a world with more robots and that could make income inequality even worse
